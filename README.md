# Hour Tracker
This program was designed for the Future Business Leaders of America 2020 State Leadership Conference. It is used to store records of community service, an important part of FBLA because of its CSA (Community Service Award) program. It stores the data by means of a SQL database that interacts with PHP code to display the information on the page in a way that is easy to understand for the user.

This was created by Reilly Ford, a senior at the Academy for Information Technology in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. If you use this code, please let me know and credit me by emailing me at reilly.ford@gmail.com.
